# photo-QR-codes
A Processing program that converts an image into a functioning QR code

Check out my paintbot repository, where all k-means and "voxelizing" is applied and explained.
There are two centroids, hence two colors. The brighter color is set to white, and less bright is set to black. 
The corners are simply drawn squares.

(8/19/21) I am still yet to turn this QR code into a functioning one (giving it a link, checking if it works etc.) but it works with images!!
